# E-commerce Backend Overview

## Components

1. **Express.js Server**: The main entry point for the application, handling HTTP requests and responses.

2. **Routes**:
   - Collection Routes: Handle endpoints related to collections (/create, /collections, /collections/:id)
   - Product Routes: Handle endpoints related to products (/, /:id, /filter, /create, /:id/related)

3. **Controllers**:
   - Collection Controller: Implements logic for creating, retrieving all, and retrieving single collections
   - Product Controller: Implements logic for CRUD operations on products, filtering, and getting related products

4. **Models**:
   - Collection Model: Defines the schema for collections (name, description)
   - Product Model: Defines the schema for products (name, collectionId, brand, tags, images, price, etc.)

5. **Product Service**: Implements business logic for product operations, including CRUD, filtering, and related product retrieval

6. **Supabase Storage**: Used for storing and managing product images

7. **MongoDB**: The database used to store collection and product data

## Key Features

- CRUD operations for both collections and products
- Image upload and management using Supabase
- Product filtering based on various criteria (brand, size, color, price range, etc.)
- Related products functionality
- Proper error handling and validation

## Notes

- The backend uses Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling
- Multer is used for handling multipart/form-data, which is necessary for file uploads
- The architecture follows a clear separation of concerns, with routes, controllers, models, and services each having distinct responsibilities
